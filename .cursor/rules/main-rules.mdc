 # Don't try to boil the ocean. Dont try to make big sweeping changes when more focused ones will do

Always think of the minimum viable solution to a problem or change to make. make sure that works and then build on top of it. break things down into small testable pieces first. That said NO CHEATING! I.e. don't comment out or skip a test to solve a problem unless just a temporary bandaid while working on something more important.


# Work to make tests as faithful to the real code as possible

its ok to mock out things that make api calls but try to use the real original code for anything that exists in this codebase.
